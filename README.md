In this assignment, I have trained an **SVM with RBF kernel** on the [Dry Bean Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/dry-bean-dataset?resource=download&select=Dry_Bean.csv).  
The dataset contains **13,611 instances** divided into **7 classes**.  

The trained model achieved an **accuracy of 92.45%**.  

The code also includes:  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction  
- **Data Visualization** for better understanding of results
